### What I learned

This is the first time i used ruby-sass.
Since I'm using Linux mint-32 bit version and my system had a lot of dependency problems and some problems with ppa repositories i could not install npm and node-sass. it's too complicated for me solve right now with my knowladge.
css grid is also something i've started practicing. 

### Continued development

I will be using sass and grid a lot from now on.
